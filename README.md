### Abstract
ERC-321 introduces a protocol for the tokenization of smart contracts, facilitating their identification, management, and seamless integration into a marketplace for smart contracts. This standard outlines the creation of contract instances with unique token IDs and encompasses the management of ownership and metadata, enabling the sale and purchase of smart contracts and their collections through a standardized interface. While supporting the tokenization of real-world assets as a use case, ERC-321 primarily aims to enhance the functionality, interoperability, and dynamism of smart contracts as assets in their own right.

### Motivation
The evolving landscape of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) underscores the need for a more dynamic, interoperable framework for smart contracts. As these contracts increasingly become assets with intrinsic value, there is a clear demand for a standardized mechanism that allows for their tokenization, trade, and aggregation. ERC-321 and the accompanying ERC-321Metadata extension cater to this demand, providing a comprehensive interface for the lifecycle management of smart contracts within a marketplace, thereby enabling creators to package and monetize their solutions effectively.

### Specification
**ERC-321 Interface:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

interface ERC321 {
    event ContractInstanceCreated(address indexed instance, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    function createInstance(bytes calldata _metadata) external returns (uint256 tokenId);
    function instanceAddress(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function instanceMetadata(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

**ERC-321Metadata Extension:**
```solidity
interface ERC321Metadata is ERC321 {
    function name() external pure returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external pure returns (string memory);
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```
---

**Example Implementation:**
```solidity
contract ContractMarketplace is ERC321, ERC321Metadata {
    // Implementation details for creating, buying, and selling smart contracts...
}
```

**Metadata Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "Decentralized Exchange Contract",
  "description": "A fully-functional DEX contract supporting ERC-20 tokens.",
  "image": "ipfs://Qm...",
  "properties": {
    "protocol": "Uniswap V2",
    "license": "MIT",
    "creator": "0x..."
  }
}
```


### Rationale
By facilitating the tokenization of smart contracts, ERC-321 addresses a significant gap in the blockchain ecosystem, enabling the commodification and exchange of smart contracts as assets. This standard not only simplifies the integration of contracts into existing dApps and platforms but also promotes the development of a vibrant marketplace where contracts can be traded, customized, and deployed by end-users. The flexibility and interoperability offered by ERC-321 are pivotal in realizing the full potential of smart contracts as modular, reusable assets.

### Security Considerations
The secure implementation of ERC-321 is paramount, especially in managing contract ownership and metadata integrity. Developers are advised to employ best practices in smart contract security and consider decentralized storage options for maintaining metadata to prevent central points of failure.

### Backwards Compatibility
ERC-321 is designed with compatibility in mind, ensuring seamless interaction with existing ERC standards and the broader Ethereum ecosystem, thereby facilitating widespread adoption.
