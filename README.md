### Abstract
ERC-321 introduces a protocol for the tokenization of smart contracts, enabling their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces. This standard provides a systematic approach to creating contract instances with unique identifiers, managing ownership, and handling metadata. It aims to support the sale, purchase, and collection of smart contracts, facilitating their use as assets with defined ownership and characteristics.

### Motivation
The advancement of blockchain technology and the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps) highlight the necessity for a protocol that can manage smart contracts more dynamically and interoperably. There exists a notable requirement for a standardized mechanism that supports the tokenization, exchange, and aggregation of smart contracts. ERC-321, along with the ERC-321Metadata extension, is designed to meet this need by offering a structured interface for smart contract lifecycle management within marketplaces. This enables the effective packaging and monetization of smart contracts, addressing the growing market for smart contract acquisition and legal trade.

### Specification
**ERC-321 Interface:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

/**
 * @title IERC321 Smart Contract Tokenization Interface
 * @dev Interface for tokenization and management of smart contracts, facilitating identification and enabling interactions like creation and metadata management.
 */
interface IERC321 {
    event ContractInstanceCreated(address indexed instance, uint256 indexed contractId);
    function createInstance(bytes calldata _metadata) external returns (uint256 contractId);
}
```

**ERC-321Metadata Extension:**
```solidity
interface IERC321Metadata is IERC321 {
    function tokenURI(uint256 contractId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

**Example Implementation:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

import "lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "../interfaces/IERC321Metadata.sol";
import "./templates/ERC721.sol";

contract ContractMarketplace is IERC321Metadata, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextContractId;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _contractInstances;
    mapping(uint256 => string) private _metadataURIs;

    constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) {
        _nextContractId = 0;
    }

    function createInstanceWithCreate2(bytes calldata _metadata, bytes32 _salt) external returns (uint256 contractId) {
        // CREATE2 logic for deploying contract instances with deterministic addresses
        // Registration of contractId, instance, and metadata URI
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 contractId) external view override returns (string memory) {
        // Return metadata URI for a given contractId
    }
}
```

### Rationale
The ERC-321 standard addresses the need for a systematic approach to smart contract tokenization, enabling the safe sale and transfer of smart contracts on marketplaces. It lays the foundation for an acquisitions market and a legal framework for smart contract sales and trade, by providing the necessary infrastructure for assigning unique identifiers to contract instances, managing ownership, and associating metadata. This standard simplifies the integration of contracts into existing and future dApps and platforms, promoting a structured marketplace where contracts can be efficiently traded and managed.

### Security Considerations
Ensuring the secure implementation of ERC-321 is crucial, with a particular emphasis on managing contract ownership and safeguarding metadata integrity. Following best practices in smart contract security and opting for decentralized storage solutions for metadata are essential steps to mitigate risks and prevent central points of failure.

### Backwards Compatibility
Designed with backward compatibility in mind, ERC-321 ensures a seamless interaction with existing ERC standards and the Ethereum ecosystem at large. This facilitates the standard's adoption, enabling its practical implementation in current systems and technologies.
